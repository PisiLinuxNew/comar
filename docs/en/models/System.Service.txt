System.Service
==============


    start():
        Starts the service.


    stop():
        Stopts the service.


    reload():
        Reloads the service.


    setState(state):
        Set service's auto start behavior. Setting state to "on" will start 
        service on startup.


    ready():
        Starts service if state is "on".


    info():
        Returns service type, description and status.

        Function should return something like that:

        01 (
        02     "service",
        03     "Apache web server",
        04     "on",
        05 ]

        Status field is a little bit tricky:
            If service state is "on", and service is running, status is "on"
            If service state is "on", but service is not running, status is "stopped"
            If service state is "off", and service is not running, status is "off"
            If service state is "off", but service is running, status is "started"


    Signals:
        Changed: Fired when a service state is changed
            Arguments:
                service: Package name
                state: Service state, same as status in info()
